# IMS Program
This project is an offline Inventory Management System, allowing items to be effiecntly, added, searched and edited. The implementation is entirely in Java, and uses the Java Swing Toolkit for its user interface.The Main functionality utilizes a LinkedHashMap for efficient add, remove, return, and update methods. The Gui Interfact uses Vectors for its JTable implementation. 

# Start Guide
Running this program is simple. Pull the code from Github and run the main function in the Testing Class. Make sure you have all neccesary dependacies installed. Once the Program starts, it functionality should be straight forward.
- The Top of the applet window contains the JTable that lists all current entries in the inventory management system. 
- The Button contains three buttons
  - Add Item - allows the user to add an item to the database, specifying name, price, and quantity. The Item ID is automatically generated usign thee hashing Function.

  ## Additional Backend Functionality
  - caluculate total revenue
  - sell products
  - alternative functions for modifying entry attributes
  
  
  
  # Dependancies
  - reguires you have the Java SDK installed
    - Developed using Oracle Open JDK 15.0.1
